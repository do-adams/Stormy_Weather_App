# Stormy Weather App
A stylish weather app for Android.

![Stormy](/Stormy.png?raw=true)

Sleek and soft on the eyes, Stormy is ready to serve up a convenient torrent of localized forecast data at a moment's whim. Built as part of completing the [Build a Weather App](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-weather-app)
and the [Android Lists and Adapters](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/android-lists-and-adapters) courses at [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), 
Stormy makes heavy usage of REST APIs, Network Calls, ListViews, RecyclerViews, Custom Adapters, Google Play Location Services, User Permissions, and more.

# Getting started

To get started building your own APK of the app on your device, simply add the following two lines to either your project gradle.properties file
or your global gradle.properties file:

<code>
MyGoogleMapsApiKey=<"INSERT_API_KEY_HERE"> 
</code>

<code>
MyDarkSkyForecastApiKey=<"INSERT_API_KEY_HERE">
</code>

You must, of course, provide your own unique API keys for these services. 

You can acquire them easily in the following links:

2. [The Dark Sky Forecast API](https://developer.forecast.io/)
